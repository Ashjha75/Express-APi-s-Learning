# Express APIs

This repository contains a set of RESTful APIs built using **Express.js**, designed to provide a robust and efficient backend for web applications. These APIs handle core functionalities like **user authentication**, **data management**, and **integration with external services**. The goal is to create a seamless bridge between the frontend and backend, allowing for smooth data flow, secure interactions, and efficient processing.

## Features

  - Secure user login and registration with password hashing.
  - Token-based authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.
  - Role-based access control for different user types.

- **Data Management**:
  - Full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing application data.
  - RESTful endpoints adhering to best practices for resource handling.
  - Support for various data types and flexible data models.

- **Integration with External Services**:
  - Connect to third-party APIs and services for enhanced functionality (e.g., payment gateways, notifications).
  - Smooth communication between your app and external resources.
  - Error handling and logging for API interactions.
